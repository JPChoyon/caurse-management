# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

First, I created a Courses component and then declared a state inside it and
then using the use effect I loaded the data in there and loaded the data and put
my data in that state and then inside that I had all the states when needed.
Either I've just passed it in that I've declared all the state in a component
and I've passed it wherever it's needed.
